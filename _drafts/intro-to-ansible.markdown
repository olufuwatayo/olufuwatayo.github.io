Ansible is way old, it was created in February 20, 2012(8 years ago) and it's still being used today for config management.

[Configuration management (CM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life. **ELI5**: what this means is that you have your software installations, your configurations, and your updates defined as a code that is re-usable, understandable and version controlled. 

If you need to make changes to your configurations you can just update your iaac codes and run it on your infrastructure without fear of it breaking your systems.

Ansible is way old, it was created in February 20, 2012(8 years ago) and it's still being used today for config management.

[Configuration management (CM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.
